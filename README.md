# CC-Fire 🔥

## 💡 Inspiration

* Covid-19 has made it harder than ever to communicate with other students in college.
* Incoming & current freshman, as well as transfer students, haven’t even gotten a chance to meet other college students in their school.
* Other college students  are feeling burnt out from a lack of diverse social interactions
* Students do not feel inspired or motivated due to a lack of new ideas.
* Students lack a dedicated platform for holding meaningful convos.
* College students need a way to have deep meaningful conversations outside of the social media platforms we’ve been using.

**What better way to have conversations & share stories than around a campfire while roasting marshmallows and eating smores?**

## 🏕️  What it does

**It’s a mobile app…**

* That allows college students to not only meet other students in their college but at other colleges as well.
* It creates a space that resembles a real-life campfire concept by integrating categories, story prompts, interactive elements (ex: smores), and options to add more firewood to keep the meaningful convos going!
* It has alot of safety & privacy precautions as well. There is a visual privacy policy to make the features are noticeable and simple for users to understand and consent to from the beginning. There is also multi-level authentication to go through a network of verified and reliable users to the platform. There is also end-to-end encryption of data to ensure that what is said at the campfire, stays at the campfire. This helps us ensure that everyone feels comfortable using our platform. I implemented a machine learning algorithm (through Natural Language Processing) to filter out profanity and negative behavior in Campsites to again ensure the comfort level of everyone at the campfire. Lastly, there are privacy reminders at every touchpoint to again reassure users that we really care about the safety of the campfire environment.

## 🔨 How I built it

* I ideated with google docs & draw.
* I worked on wireframes on Figma.
* I made low, then high fidelity prototypes on Figma.

## 😤 Challenges I ran into

* Finding teammates to create a project with.
* Working on the hack alone, as I am beginner.
* Working on 35+ screens
* Time constraints ( I started late, as it took me to know what the theme was as I couldn’t attend the opening ceremony & couldn’t access my discord account.)

## 🏆 Accomplishments that I'm proud of

* Completing my project on time despite the challenges stated above.
* Completing 35+ screens **ALL** by myself.
* Competing for the first time as a solo!

## 📖 What I learned

* I learned more about user personas & user research
* I learned more about app design and UI
* I learned about using my research to create the UX
* I learned about design systems (typography, color, branding, etc.)

## 🚀 What's next for _CC Fire_

* Partner with mobile and/or web developer to make my app more accessible to as many people as people
* Host ads & partner with colleges to introduce the app to their students.
* Make a sister app for high school & middle school students and make this safe space available to them as well.
